      In today's fast-paced and interconnected world where information is just a few clicks away, we rely heavily upon
      cloud technologies. Cloud in layman terms is just a bunch of servers that provide computation power and storage.
      Cloud Services provide on-demand availability of computing resources in a pay as you go, pricing model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pay as you go model helps in:
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li>Lowering your operating costs</li>
      <li>Running your infrastructure efficiently</li>
      <li>Scale as your business needs change</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why move to the Cloud?
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li>Moving to the cloud gets one access to nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage and networking components
      </li>
      <li>Cloud services could be beneficial if one wants to integrate speech recognition and other cognitive services
        in their products</li>
      <li>Could be beneficial in integrating analytics services and telemetry data from software and devices</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Some Cloud Computing Advantages</h2>
    <h3>Reliability</h3>
    <p style="display: block;">
      In a perfect world, our systems would be 100% reliable. But unfortunately, that is not the case services do
      experience faults caused due to multiple factors like server downtime, software failures, security breaches, etc.
      Cloud services can aid businesses in increasing their service reliability. Businesses can rent additional
      resources that can act as redundant power that kicks in automatically if something goes wrong.
      <br />
      Reliability is a crucial factor in a business setting as any downtime could be the reason to lost revenue and
      trust. Therefore, one must invest in good resources and test their systems against real-world scenarios before
      actually deploying the final product.
    </p>
    <h3>Scalability</h3>
    <p>
      <u><i>Vertical Scaling</i></u><br />
      Vertical scaling refers to adding more resources like RAM or CPUs to your server. It usually means upgrading the
      hardware of a server. In this kind of scaling risk of downtime is higher as compared to horizontal scaling.
      <br /><br />
      <u><i>Horizontal Scaling</i></u><br />
      Horizontal scaling results in a much higher service availability as compared to vertical scaling. It involves
      adding instance of a resource, such as adding more virtual machines to your configuration.
    </p>
    <h3>Elasticity</h3>
    <p>Elasticity is how quickly a business can add or remove resources on demand. During high demand periods, the
      business
      would have to increase its computing resources to meet the demands of its customers. But, when the user traffic
      decreases, there is no need for those extra resources, they are just sitting idle. Therefore, businesses need to
      adapt quickly,
      keeping in mind their customer demographic.</p>
    <h3>Agility</h3>
    <p>Using cloud computing solutions businesses can bring their product to market in a lesser time frame. Development
      teams can focus on the core functionality of the software, leaving the server maintenance and up-keep to the cloud
      services providers.</p>
    <h3>Geo-Distribution</h3>
    <p>As we discussed earlier, the cloud is a bunch of servers that provide computing power and storage. These servers
      housed in large data centres could be situated anywhere in the world. So, what this means for a business is that
      by choosing a data centre near to their target audience they can get faster speeds and lower delay time and lag.
    </p>
    <h3>Disaster Recovery</h3>
    <p>Disaster recovery is a crucial aspect of cloud services. Due to virtualization, the entire server, including the
      OS, applications, patches and data is bundled into a single software or virtual server which can be backed up at
      another data centre and can kick in, in the event of a disaster. In businesses where each passing second means
      losing millions in revenue, cloud disaster recovery could be a lifesaver.</p>
