    <p>
      In today's fast-paced and interconnected world where information is just a few clicks away, we rely heavily upon
      cloud technologies. Cloud in layman terms is just a bunch of servers that provide computation power and storage.
      Cloud Services provide on-demand availability of computing resources in a pay as you go, pricing model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pay as you go model helps in:
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li>Lowering your operating costs</li>
      <li>Running your infrastructure efficiently</li>
      <li>Scale as your business needs change</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why move to the Cloud?
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li>Moving to the cloud gets one access to nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage and networking components
      </li>
      <li>Cloud services could be beneficial if one wants to integrate speech recognition and other cognitive services
        in their products</li>
      <li>Could be beneficial in integrating analytics services and telemetry data from software and devices</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Some Cloud Computing Advantages</h2>
    <h3>Reliability</h3>
    <p style="display: block;">
      In a perfect world, our systems would be 100% reliable. But unfortunately, that is not the case services do
      experience faults caused due to multiple factors like server downtime, software failures, security breaches, etc.
      Cloud services can aid businesses in increasing their service reliability. Businesses can rent additional
      resources that can act as redundant power that kicks in automatically if something goes wrong.
      <br />
      Reliability is a crucial factor in a business setting as any downtime could be the reason to lost revenue and
      trust. Therefore, one must invest in good resources and test their systems against real-world scenarios before
      actually deploying the final product.
